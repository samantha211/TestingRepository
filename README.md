## BUSINESS NEED
<p align="justify">
University campus bookstores play an essential role in supporting the academic activity of students and the research work of staff, and well as the cultural identity of the university. At a time when universities are trying to lower student costs, the university campus bookstore can play a significant role by generating additional campus revenue, thereby offsetting certain university fees charged to students. As a result of the current pandemic, classes have moved transitioned to being completely online, and the Fairfield University campus and Bookstore have been shut down indefinitely. This has had a noticeable impact on campus revenue. As Fairfield University students, we identified that this issue could be resolved putting our Software Engineering skills to build an online web application for the Fairfield University Store. This online web application allows students and faculty to continue to access the Fairfield University store online and to make purchases while being socially distanced in the safety of their homes.
